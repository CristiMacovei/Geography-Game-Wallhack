# Geography Game Wallhack

## Introduction

This project is a chrome extension, designed to help you get a good score on geogra.ro ( some random website my hs teacher really likes apparently so instead of learning 40something countries, I decided to pull a programmer move and spend the whole week on this thing which most likely will never get used, but hey at least I tried right? )

## How it works? (or at least how I hope it's gonna work)

It automatically reads the prompt and highlights the country (, river, city or whatever entity that our educational system thinks it's important for us to memorise like a mentally challenged beaver).

## How to install

There's a link in the releases section, if you're unable to figure out you're no smarter than a mole.

## How to use

As plug and play as it gets. If you're having trouble, I probably fucked something up (I have a tendency to do so, that's why I'm a programmer and not a doctor).
